# Adaptive Game Dev Summer 2025 🌿🎮
Research & prototyping repo for exploring adaptive gameplay systems, player modeling, and AI-driven NPCs — in preparation for my MFA thesis project at NYU IDM.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a series of small prototypes focused on adaptive difficulty, NPC behavior, and emotion-responsive systems
- Explore how games can dynamically change based on player skill, playstyle, and emotional decisions
- Research procedural content generation (PCG), player modeling, and machine learning applications in games
- Develop a vertical slice of an AI-driven boss fight or branching NPC interaction by Fall 2025
