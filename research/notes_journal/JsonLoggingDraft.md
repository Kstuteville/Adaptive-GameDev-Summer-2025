Draft of JSON Logging System (Mock Script)
Mock system to log boss/player interactions into a dummy JSON structure
(could be printed to console or later written to file)


What is a Json logging system?
A structure in my game that records events or data in real time in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Json is 
Human readable (easy to print debug)
Machine parsable (easy to feed into analytics tools or AI models
Flexible (you can store damage, states, behavior patterns etc)
This system logs gameplay events like
When the player hits the boss
When the boss changes states (IDle→ Rage)
When the player dodges or heals
What the boss decides to do in response
This becomes my data backbone for
Debugging AI logic
Studying Player BEhavior
Making the AI adapt Dynamically based on this data
Later→ feeding machine learning or tuning rules

This logging system helps with
Tracking player behavior →
{
  "eventType": "PlayerHitBoss",
  "time": 15.28,
  "damage": 10,
  "comboCount": 3
}
Lets say you track 3 hits in 5 seconds→ trigger a rage state
Or track repeated dodge spamming→ boss uses grab instead of swipe
I NEED DATA for the AI to reason
- Debugging state transitions
	→ when the boss switches states (Idle→ rage→ stunned), log: 
{
  "eventType": "BossStateChange",
  "oldState": "Idle",
  "newState": "Rage",
  "trigger": "3HitsIn5s",
  "time": 17.04
}
		This helps us visually trace what triggered a behabior even during playtests


Tuning the adaptive system 
During early dev r research
Log how often players trigger rage
Did they abuse healing or spam attacks?
Later they use the data to
Adjust thresholds
Design counters
Refine challenge balancing
Building research data 
Eventually If i am measuring
How well the AI responded to different player types,
Emotional impact of boss adaptation 
Player reaction to dynamic challenge→
THis system gives me actual JSON logs I can analyze post-session, even with: python, excel, visual analytics

You are building the memory of your boss fight system.
Without a JSON logging system:
The boss reacts blindly and forgets what’s happened.
With a JSON logging system:
You give the boss perception and history—so it can analyze the past, react in the present, and adapt in the future.















CODE

using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class BossLogger : MonoBehaviour
{
    private List<Dictionary<string, object>> eventLog = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>();

    public void LogEvent(string eventType, string source, string target, float time, Dictionary<string, object> extraData = null)
    {
        var logEntry = new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            {"eventType", eventType},
            {"source", source},
            {"target", target},
            {"time", time},
            {"data", extraData ?? new Dictionary<string, object>()}
        };

        eventLog.Add(logEntry);
        Debug.Log(JsonUtility.ToJson(new SerializableDictionary(logEntry))); // Console dummy output
    }
}


Trigger a log like this
logger.LogEvent("Hit", "Player", "Boss", Time.time, new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    {"damage", 10},
    {"comboCount", 3}
});
