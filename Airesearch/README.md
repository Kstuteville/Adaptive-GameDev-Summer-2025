Key Files:
BossBehaviorController.cs
This file will handle adaptive behaviors for the boss based on player skill, as previously discussed.

BossStateMachine.cs
This handles the FSM transitions for the boss. It will decide when the boss should enter a different state (Idle, Chase, Attack, Rage, etc.). This would be linked to BossFSM.

BossAttackPattern.cs
This file would define various attack patterns for the boss based on the player's skill tier. For example, in "Experienced" mode, the boss might use a combination of high-damage attacks with feints.

BossFeintManager.cs
This could manage specific mechanics like feints or attacks that trick the player, designed for higher skill tiers.

NPCBehaviorController.cs
This is for NPC behavior, including how NPCs interact with the player and the world. Could be useful for creating systems like quest givers, shopkeepers, or hostile enemies.

NPCDispositionManager.cs
Manages how NPCs feel about the player (e.g., friendly, neutral, or hostile) and could change based on player actions or choices.

NPCMovementController.cs
Controls NPC movement using pathfinding algorithms or state machines to determine how they navigate the world.

PlayerBehaviorController.cs
This file could manage the AI that governs how the player moves and interacts with NPCs, based on their actions, skills, and stats.

SkillTierClassifier.cs
This class classifies the playerâ€™s skill level based on the tracked metrics (dodge success, accuracy, etc.). It will update the player's skill tier dynamically.
