//in unity have to create UI element in order to use this script

//HOW TO CONNECT TO GAME
//1. In Unity, attach the SkillMetricsUI.cs script to an empty GameObject in your scene, such as SkillMetricsController.
//2.In the Inspector, drag the AccuracyText and DodgeText UI elements to the corresponding fields in the SkillMetricsUI script component.
//3. If the BossLogger is managing the attack/dodge stats, drag the BossLogger component from your LoggerTest GameObject into the bossLogger field in the SkillMetricsUI script component.

//to test 
//Now, whenever you simulate hits or dodges in your game (using RegisterAttack(true/false) or RegisterDodge(true/false)), the UI will update in real-time.
//You should see Accuracy and Dodge Success displayed on the screen, based on the playerâ€™s actions.
