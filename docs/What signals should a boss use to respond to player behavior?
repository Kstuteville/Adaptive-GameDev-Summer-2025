What signals should a boss use to respond to player behavior?
In an adaptive boss fight, a boss should respond intelligently to distinct patterns in player behavior to create a dynamic and emotionally engaging experience. For example, when the player deals aggressive burst damage—such as landing multiple hits in a short time—the boss might enter a Rage or Defensive state to counter that momentum. If the player tends to keep distance and engage in long-range kiting, the boss could respond by switching to a Chase behavior or activating ranged attacks to close the gap. Players who frequently dodge can be countered with delayed attacks or fakes to catch them off-guard. Repeated parrying by the player could prompt the boss to use Unblockable moves or staggered attacks to throw off their rhythm. Additionally, if the player is low on health but baiting the boss, the AI can recognize the vulnerability and become more aggressive or unpredictable. These behavioral signals—like spamming, healing, dodging, or baiting—serve as inputs for the adaptive system, allowing the boss to reflect, mirror, or subvert player expectations, resulting in richer gameplay.
