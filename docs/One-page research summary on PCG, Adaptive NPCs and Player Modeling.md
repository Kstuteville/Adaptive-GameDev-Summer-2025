One-page research summary on PCG, Adaptive NPCs and Player Modeling

In the evolving landscape of interactive game design, modern games start to implement intelligent systems that respond dynamically to player behavior. This research explores the intersection of three critical components in adapted game design: Player Modeling, Adaptive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and Procedural Generation. Together with this research, I aim to create a responsive, personalized and replayable experience that enhances immersion and player agency.

Player Modelng is the computational process of inferring a playerâ€™s traits, preferences, habits, behavbiors through data-driven analysis. Models may track observable metrics such as movement patterns, combat styles and decision making throughout the game. These models enable games to better understand who the player is and mold to it. For example a player who charges right into battle with no sneaking around might be identified as brave and not stealth-oriented, informing how the game might adapt to future encounters or narratives with the player.

Adaptive NPCs are game characters whose behavior, dialogue, and decisions are based on the player's model or actions. Many NPCs are coded with fixed behaviors, but adaptive NPCs might learn to trust or distrust a player, offer different quests, or alter strategies depending on past interactions. These systems might rely on emotional state tracking, trust scores, and memory logs to simulate more lifelike social behavior, deepening the narrative complexity and emotional engagement. 
Procedural Generation refers to the algorithmic creation of game content such as levels, quests, environments or dialogue, rather than manually designing every asset. Procedural systems can be randomized or conditioned on player behavior (i.e., adaptive procedural generation), allowing game worlds to feel unique and personalized while reducing development overhead. When paired with player modeling, procedural generation can create game content that is both novel and meaningfully tailored to each player.
This research seeks to integrate these systems to design a single-scene game environment where player actions influence NPC trust, narrative outcomes, and potentially even the game space itself. Through a combination of rule-based logic and machine learning techniques, the goal is to investigate how games can respond emotionally and mechanically to players in real time, enhancing immersion and fostering deeper engagement.
